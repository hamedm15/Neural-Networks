# Machine Learning Coursework 2 â€“ Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks by Ryan Ward, Panagiotis Doumas, Hamed Mohammed

## Overview

Implemented a multi-layered neural network from scratch, including backpropagation algorithm, for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Developed and optimised a neural network architecture to predict the price of houses in California using the California House Prices Dataset. Utilising the PyTorch library to model the average house prices in different locations within California.

## Repository Structure

- [Report](report.pdf)
- [Neural Network mini-library](part1_nn_lib.py)
- [Data](housing.csv): California House Prices Dataset
- [Implementaion](part2_house_value_regression.py): Multi-layer Neural Network in Python 
- [Trained Model](part2_model.pickle): pickle file for trained neural network

## Installation and Usage

- Neural Network mini-library
 run "python3 part1_nn_lib.py" in terminal

- Trained neural network for regression
 run "python3 part2_house_value_regression.py" in terminal
Uses functions from Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, NumPy and Pandas libraries

- part2_model.pickle is the pickle file created
