# Introduction to Machine Learning
Coursework 2: Artificial Neural Networks
## Overview

Implemented a multi-layered neural network from scratch, including backpropagation algorithm, for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Developed and optimised a neural network architecture to predict the price of houses in California using the California House Prices Dataset. Utilising the PyTorch library to model the average house prices in different locations within California.

## Structure

- Neural Network mini-library
 run "python3 part1_nn_lib.py" in terminal

- Trained neural network for regression
 run "python3 part2_house_value_regression.py" in terminal

- part2_model.pickle is the pickle file created
